The Trot Programming Language


Trot characteristics:
---------------------
- Only has two types: list and int.
- Stack based with reverse polish notation.
- Uses the actor model for easy concurrent programming.
- Automatic memory management with instant garbage collection.
- Licensed under a three-clause BSD license (see LICENSE)

This is my personal weekend project, so progress will be slow but steady.

The current version is 0.1.0.
That means I'm still developing the foundation for the language, so you can't
write anything in the language yet.


Building:
---------
Just run "make"

targets:
  all      - build normal
  debug    - build for debug
  test     - run tests
  vtest    - run tests in valgrind
  coverage - generate coverage report with gcov and lcov
  clean    - cleans up files


Testing and Validation:
-----------------------
- Trot is compiled with gcc's -Wall -Werror and -Wextra.
  It compiles with 0 warnings.
- Lots of unit tests guarantee everything works correctly.
- gcov is used to make sure we get as much coverage as possible.
  Current coverage is 98.54%. There's only a few cases that are not covered. One
  is a "should never happen" paranoid case, and the rest are for when "malloc"
  fails. I still need to figure out how I want to write tests for these.
- Valgrind is used to look for memory leaks and memory corruption.
  There are 0 memory leaks or errors reported.


Documentation:
--------------
The code is documented with doxygen comments, and there's a trot.doxygen file
that can be used to generate documentation. Structures and functions are
documented, but more documentation will come about the core data structure and
the memory management algorithms.
